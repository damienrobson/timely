# Timely

## Do More.

Timely is an advanced task management application, written in React with pure HTML and CSS with a focus on accessibility from the outset. It is not a real-world/production app; instead it is intended to act as a playground application where things can be tried out as and when needed.

### Quick-start

In your favourite terminal:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
